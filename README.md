# EuroCity package
This R package was developed as the final project of the course "Programming The Next Step" at the University of Amsterdam. 

EuroCity provides statistical comparisons of European cities based on indicators of quality of life (life satisfaction, living expenses, environment, culture etc.) and living expenses. 
It includes an R shiny app which provides a user iterface to compare different European cities based on chosen quality of life indicators, and living expenses, and which visualizes the results.

In order to start the app, run `shall_I_move()` in R. You can furthermore make use of buildt-in filter functions to get the data you are interested in. For further details, see the vignette in `./vignettes`. 

## Data 

Data is combined from the Report on the Quality of life in European Cities 2020, the cost-of-living-and-prices API (retrieved in May 2023), and the World Happiness Report 2023.
